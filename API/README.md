To run API on an IP :
	For the first run :
		1. Make sure python and pip are installed and added to PATH
		2. Run Dependencies.bat
		3. Keep continuing
	For any subsequent runs :
		1. If training dataset has changed, run Dumps.bat
		2. Otherwise run start.bat
		3. Follow on-screen instructions
	These steps will make the API go online. Now you send POST requests to the API with test data and it will return a prediction.
